That's why 2 opens in the same stock counts as 2 and the 1 open 2 closes counts as only 1.\n\nSometimes when you're daytrading you might want to increase the position you started if the trade is going well. Also, it can be advantageous to sell part of a position to lock in some profit and let the remainder ride.\n\nThe practice is called scaling in &amp; scaling out. Usually people use 1/2 or 1/3. Once you can trade all day long there's more choices available. \n\nPlus if you are trading on a per share rate it really doesn't matter much. The  bots &amp; some traders do it 100 shares at a time. \n\nIt was kinda confusing when I first started daytrading. I wanted to make absolutely sure that I didn't mess it up and get my account locked.\n\nScottrade had several nice clear examples. \n\nhttps://research.scottrade.com/knowledgecenter/Public/education/Article?docId=59c2e9d10010443ba3dbc53db3b360f2",

I thought because stocks are not immediately put into my possession when I execute a trade, if I trade a stock in the interim while possession has not transferred over within the period, it counts as a day trade based on my understanding from the internet, but I'll give my branch a call and get clarification.

If they have tens of millions of users and can establish a network that can then be monetized, that could potentially be interesting. Whether or not they could execute on that is a giant if and would require significant resources and incredible execution.\n\nWhat you're talking about with using \"GoPro\" as a verb is something I was always taught is a negative. I can't remember the exact Econ 101 term, but having a brand name become almost ubiquitous with a product can actually have adverse effects.
